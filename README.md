# CDMPP computing material

This repository contains material I developed for computing workshops I run for the Centre for Dark Matter Particle Physics.

In order of delivery these are:

1. Introduction to research computing (CDM_intro_freezeout.ipynb)

2. Frequentist and Bayesian inference (CDM_statistics_inference.ipynb)

3. Monte Carlo Methods (CDM_MonteCarlo_methods.ipynb)
